# stopwatch
Stopwatch project used as a vehicle to use TDD and Qunit. 
Needs to start stop and reset

##Tests Created
1. records start time 
2. records stop time
3. records current time 
4. records time difference
4. splits time into human readable format 

## How 
1. create functions that a stopwatch needs/ start time/ stop time/ human time converter etc
2. create a html page 
3. finally give it some style 

## Learning outcomes
1. TDD is super hard - writing code in a way that is easily testable is conufusing
2. Making a stopwatch is more complex than it sounds
3. You can't call a function every millisecond - it makes your computer sad 
4. animations are fun
